# Cracking-The-Coding-Interview-Questions
Working through Cracking the Coding Interview 5th Edition by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

I am working through the problems in order to test my skills, learn more, and to prepare for any future interviews.  

All solutions are created solely by myself, without any help from the included solutions found in the book.  As such, 
several of the solutions may not be as efficient as possible, but should likely avoid worst-case O.

Feel free to take a look, and perhaps suggest a change to my solutions.
